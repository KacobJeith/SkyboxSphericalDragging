# SkyboxSphericalDragging
Another drag and drop, but this time in spherical space!

I figured there aren't enough drag and drop implementations out there, so here's another. This time, you are a rotating camera within a photosphere, and there are floating cubes around you that you can drag around the scene. 

# Running
This is built in Unity 2017.1.2
Hosting is run on Firebase, using the default WebGL build of the project

# Demo
